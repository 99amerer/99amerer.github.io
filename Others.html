Me and my sister have had the classic sibling rivalry. It started a very long time ago, when I had no hair and was maybe a year or so old. What she decided to do wsa that when we would get some stickers she would decide to stick them to my bald head, this I believe has led to me extreme hatred of stickers. There have been times when we would be at each others throats, and others when we couldn't care less. We have hit each other, we have jumped into a freezing lake together, we have had our birthday's 5 days apart "<i>much to our mothers dismay</i>", and when we lost Kiwi the first cat we had and that had been with us since we were little, we cried together.
