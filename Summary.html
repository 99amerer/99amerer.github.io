<P>My dad is a very precise person. He works as an engineer for <u>The Fitch Company</u>. His sense of humor could be improved but it still exsists. He was one of the leading forces that got me through Boy Scouts during the points where I would have rather given up. From time to time we would go on hiking trips that usually ended up with him taking a "<i>Short cut</i>" that would make a 4 hour hiking trip from leaving the house to getting back, into a 8 hour hiking trip.
