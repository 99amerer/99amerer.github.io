I have had a lot of experiences in my life so far, some of them being rather fun, like the time I went to six flags, of rather painful, like the time I dislocated my knee. I have been in Boy Scouts since I was very young and it has been a very long journey to Eagle, which is where I am now. I perfer to live with my view on the world being rather simple and open-minded, so long as nothing you do hurts anyone else and it wont get me involved I say you can do whatever you want. I have been known around my friends as the more quiet one since I can be perfectly fine with not talking for long stretches of time, and can be rather timid in social situations.
