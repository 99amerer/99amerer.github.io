<P>My mother is a very interesting person. She is very optimistic most of the time and knows how to have fun within reason. She works out on a regular basis. When she turned 50 years old she decided to run a marathon, and she usually goes on a lot of different runs. When she was in College she was voted as most shy, something that since then she has decided to change. She works as a photographer and also substitutes very often. Now whenever we go somewhere she always finds someone to talk to or that she knows, the worst case of which was when I was in my high school Spanish class and the person I was working with asked me if my mom was "Ms Rice" which was very awkward. I get along with her very well and I often mess around with her in a playful manner.
